This is a lightweight reimplementation of core ROS concepts, focusing on `roscore` and topic-based communication for subscribing and publishing. Built entirely in Go without external libraries, it mimics essential ROS behavior in a minimalistic way. The `roscore` server manages message exchanges between nodes, while topics enable asynchronous communication.

This aims to mimic the essential behavior of ROS in a minimalistic way, making it easier to understand the underlying mechanisms while maintaining flexibility and performance due to Goâ€™s concurrency model.
